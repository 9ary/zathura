zathura - a document viewer
===========================

zathura is a highly customizable and functional document viewer based on the
girara user interface library and several document libraries.

Requirements
------------

meson (>= 0.43)
gtk3 (>= 3.10)
glib (>= 2.50)
girara (>= 0.2.8)
sqlite3 (optional, >= 3.5.9)
check (optional, for tests)
intltool
libmagic from file(1) (optional, for mime-type detection)
libsynctex from TeXLive (optional, for SyncTeX support)
Sphinx (optional, for manpages and HTML documentation)
doxygen (optional, for HTML documentation)
breathe (optional, for HTML documentation)
sphinx_rtd_theme (optional, for HTML documentation)

Also note that Sphinx is needed to build the manpages.  If it is not
installed, the man pages won't be built. For the HTML documentation, doxygen,
breathe and sphinx_rtd_theme are needed in addition to Sphinx.

If you don't want to build with support for sqlite databases, you can set
enable-sqlite=off and sqlite support won't be available.

The use of magic to detect mime types is optional and can be disabled by setting
enable-magic=off.

Installation
------------

To build and install zathura:

  meson build
  cd build
  ninja
  ninja install

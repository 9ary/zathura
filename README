zathura - a document viewer
--------------------
zathura is a highly customizable and functional document viewer based on the
girara user interface library and several document libraries.

Requirements
------------
gtk2 (>= 2.18.6)
girara
sqlite3 (>= 3.5.9)
check (for tests)
intltool

Please note that you need to have a working pkg-config installation and that the
Makefile is only compatible with GNU make. If you don't have a working
pkg-config installation please set the GTK_INC, GTK_LIB, GIRARA_INC, GIRARA_LIB,
SQLITE_INC and SQLITE_LIB variables accordingly.

And also note that rst2man from python-docutils is needed to build the man pages.
If it is not installed, the man pages won't be built.

If you don't want to build with support for sqlite databases, you can set
WITH_SQLITE=0 and sqlite support won't be available. Please note that sqlite3
with metadata support is required, i.e. sqlite3 has to be built with
SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA defined.
